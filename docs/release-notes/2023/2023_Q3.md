**Voltage Encryption**

- Added encryption using the Fiserv Voltage Protector to encrypt data before sending it in a request to the KNL API. This is so client data is not exposed in transit.

**Keying and Linking**

- Added a connector service to help connect to the Keying and Linking API so that the application can query for the consumer ID.
